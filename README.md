flexCloudMine
=============

A CloudMine interface library for Flex/AS3

CloudMine (cloudmine.me) is a cool backend library for schema-less data storage.  I took a weekend a while back to explore the possibilities of using it as a backend to Mobile Flex (Air) applications.  This library is the result.

It's only a start, but perhaps someone will find it useful and can build off of it from here.
